OP1 is still one of my favorite OPs ever. The visual language is just so good. The flowers for example, are seen falling in perfect unison, which gives a very unnatural feeling. But it&#039;s symbolic of not only the way Oyashiro&#039;s curse is affecting everyone in the village, but the uniformity of it all kind of implies that everything is being planned by *someone* or something. Like an organized conspiracy feeling. Of course it also foreshadows that there is a lot of death coming. The flowers fit very well with the the setting, and the trippiness of them and how in your face they are at some points, makes you feel a bit suffocated too.<br><br>I also love the shot zooming out from the candle while its flame goes out.
